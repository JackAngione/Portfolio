----SETUP FRONTEND----
Switch server addresses (src/serverInfo.jsx) from dev to prod addresses
npm run build
copy items in dist folder to nginx folder with matching name
----SETUP BACKEND----
TrueNAS Server Application setup:
to attach file storage to media_server:
    security context- privileged, custom userid
    storage - mount at /server_files, enable ACL, acl entry: same user id as in security context
           FULL_CONTROL and Force Flag


------TroubleShooting------
Make sure public IP didn't change and mess up domain link
Make sure server local IP didn't change which removes port forward

DOCKER INFO/TROUBLESHOOTING:
-login before building the container and pushing
-troubleshoot -> clean/purge data  fixes pushing issues
-run "docker init" if you need to make a new Dockerfile
